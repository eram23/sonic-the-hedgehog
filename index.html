                <h1>10 Cool Sonic Facts</h1>
                <ul id="tribute-facts">
                    <li><strong>FACT 1</strong> - Ohshima designed Sonic to provide Sega with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 2</strong> - Sonic's blue pigmentation was chosen to match Sega's cobalt blue logo, and his shoes evolved from a design inspired by both Santa Claus.</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 3</strong> - Sonic's first shown appearance in a video game was in the 1991 arcade racing game Rad Mobile as a hanging rear view mirror ornament.</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 4</strong> - Sonic's only weakness is that he cannot swim, sinking like a rock if plunged to a deep body of water. The reason for this is because Yuji Naka had a misunderstanding about hedgehogs not being able to swim.</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 5</strong> - In 1993, Sonic became the first video game character to have a balloon in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 6</strong> - Sonic has also been featured in two different manga. One series was simply called Sonic the Hedgehog, and featured a story about a normal hedgehog boy named Nicky who can change into Sonic</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 7</strong> - In the comics, his full name is Sonic Maurice the Hedgehog.</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 8</strong> - The color of his fur is meant to represent peace, trust, and — of course — being cool, according to Yuji Naka.rio</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 9</strong> - Sonic hates oppression and staunchly defends freedom.</li>
                    <li><strong>FACT 10</strong> - Sonic makes cameos in various other games, such as Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg as a power-up, in the main hallway in Phantasy Star Universe, and in the 2008 remake of Samba de Amigo.</li>
